To fit my school project I've refactored Remotely to be a Space Invader game, however if you adjust the routes you can use the rest of the framework as wel. The game is pretty cool thought, you should give it a try.

RemoteControll is a Rails project that allows users to upload a TouchOCS file and have it converted to a html5 interaface with a socket connection. This interface can than be used to controll interactive installations whereever there is an internet connection.
