	<h3>What's Space Invaders PLUS?</h3>
	<p>It's Space Invaders, but PLUS! Instead of one lonely tank defending our beloved earth, a small army kills these attacking enemies with awesome powers!<p>
	<p>That army's called The Allied Factions, and you can be part of it TODAY! As a matter of fact, as you opened this page, you probably already are!<p>
		
	<h3>How to play this game?</h3>
	<p>Pretty simple. By opening the page you're currently on, you joined The Allied Factions! You probably found this url on a Big Screen, right? Look at it, there's a tank there you control! Use <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> to move, <b>spacebar</b> to shoot! Kill those horrible ugly green squares, defend your planet!</p>
	
	<h3>What if there's no Big Screen around?</h3>
	<p>Then you can set one up yourself. To do so, you need to have a Big Screen attatched to a computer with internet. Open a full screen browser on that screen, preferably Google Chrome, and go to <a href="http://remotely.heroku.com/apps/spp">http://remotely.heroku.com/apps/spp</a>. Once the page is done loading, you can start playing by visting the page you are on right now.</p>
	
	<h3>Please be advised!</h3>
	<p>Use only one Big Screen at a time. If there are multiple Big Screens, members of the Allied Factions will show up on all Big Screens, causing major confusion!</p>
